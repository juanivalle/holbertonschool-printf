##Description

The function represents the capabilities of the printf function that is included in the C library file stdio.h.
This time we are reduced to using the following conversion specifiers: c, s, d, i. Each of which begins with the % character.
The first argument that printf receives is fixed and is the format string, it describes the format that will be applied to the corresponding argument.
